# Adaptive Model Compression and Learning Framework

This repository provides a modular, efficient, and innovative neural network training framework that supports dynamic parameter compression and learning adaptation strategies.

## üì¶ Features

- **Adaptive Parameter Folding**: Compresses model parameters based on importance scores.
- **Efficiency-Aware Learning**: Adjusts learning strategy based on target loss and resource usage.
- **Modular Architecture**: Easily pluggable and reusable in other machine learning workflows.
- **Built with PyTorch**: Compatible with PyTorch models and training loops.

## üìÅ Files

- `adaptive_model.py`: Main module containing:
  - `AdaptiveParameterFolder`: Handles dynamic parameter compression.
  - `EfficiencyAwareLearning`: Adjusts learning behavior based on feedback.
  - `AdaptiveNeuralNet`: Sample neural network.
  - Utility functions for training and compression reporting.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/adaptive-model.git
cd adaptive-model
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have `torch` and `numpy` installed:

```bash
pip install torch numpy
```

### 3. Run the Example

```bash
python adaptive_model.py
```

### 4. Use as a Module

```python
from adaptive_model import AdaptiveNeuralNet, train_model, compress_and_report

model = AdaptiveNeuralNet(input_size=10)
X, y = generate_sample_data()
trained_model = train_model(model, X, y)
compress_and_report(trained_model)
```
